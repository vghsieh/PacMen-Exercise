# Pacman Factory Exercise

## Description
This is a PacMan factory, where on each click of the button "Add PacMan" is clicked, a new PacMan image is added. 
The button "Start game" begins the movement of the PacMen across the screen. 

## Installation and Usage
The link to this live page is [here](https://vghsieh.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/). Simply load this page. When you click on "Add PacMan", PacMan images load on the page. When you click on "Start Game", the images start to move and bounce off the edges of the window. You can also add additional PacMan images while the game has started to increase the number of PacMen on the screen.

## Roadmap
Future courses of action can be to speed up or slow down the PacMen images on the screen by adding additional buttons. 
Other actions can be to have the PacMan images change based on the bounce on the edges of the window.
